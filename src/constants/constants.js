    description:
      "In this project, I migrated a jQuery plugin to React for a financial web application, using several key technologies. I initialized a new React environment and utilized the MUI library to seamlessly convert existing components. For form management, I integrated React Hook Form, which offers a hook-based approach for data collection and validation. To efficiently manage global UI state, I employed the Context API alongside the Reducer pattern. I also styled the application with Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. This project concluded with publishing the React component as an npm package, complete with documentation. This experience greatly enhanced my skills in modern front-end development, particularly in performance optimization and technical documentation.",

    description:
      "In this project, I developed the front-end of a banking application using React and Redux, focusing on creating a dynamic and responsive user experience. I integrated the front-end with the back-end through REST API calls, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server. Redux was employed for state management, maintaining consistent data flow across the application. Additionally, I used Swagger to define API endpoints and model interactions with transaction data, ensuring clear API documentation. For the back-end, I utilized Node.js with MongoDB as the database, and implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication. This project significantly enhanced my skills in API authentication, state management in React, and full-stack development using MongoDB and Node.js.",
